Puzzle : There is a place with 100 monkeys and 100 doors. There exists one key for each door and is given to each monkey. That key can be used either to open the door or to close it. All the doors are closed in the Beginning. So the first monkey enters and opens all the doors that exist on the table of 1 example) 1,2,3,4... till 100. Now the second monkey comes and goes through the doors of table 2 and opens the door if its closed and closes the door if opened. Similarly the third monkey does the same for the table of 3. Now after all the monkeys have been through, which all doors will remain open?

Answer : Consider the door 56, monkeys will visit it for every divisor it has. So 56 has 1 and 56, 2 and 28, 4 and 14, 7 and 8. So on pass 1st monkey door is opened and on 2nd its been closed. Since the number of divisors are even so at the end the door will remain closed. But in case of Perfect Squares like 9, 16, 27 etc. the number of divisors will be odd so the door will remain opened at the end.
